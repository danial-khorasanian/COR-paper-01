Three main groups of files are included in this folder: 1. G1 instances, 2. optimal solutions of G1 instances, and 3. optimal solutions of the first three groups of Taillard instances.

1. G1 instances:
G1_number of jobs_number of machines_problem number, in the file we have:
First element: number of jobs
Second element: number of machines
Then, the processing times of jobs 1 to n on machine 1,
the processing times of jobs 1 to n on machine 2, and so on.


2. Optimal solutions of G1 instances
The general form of the files is as G1_Opt_Solution_number of jobs_number of machines_problem number, in each of which, we have the corresponding optimal solution
In addition, the first element of each file is the total completion time of the optimal solution.


3. Optimal solutions of the first three groups of Taillard instances
The general form of the files is as Tail_Opt_Solution_number of instance, in each of which, we have the corresponding optimal solution
